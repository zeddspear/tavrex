# Final hardening audit — September 24, 2026

The application is deployed at https://tavrex-ai.pages.dev. The final runtime
revision is `0ed0533`, deployment `14c0f9ed`. No Tier C features were added.
Submission still needs the candidate's manual repository push/visibility check
and the assessment's camera-on walkthrough, previously omitted by instruction.

## Data audit and changes

The previous public showcase used four frontend meeting objects, a bundled search
index, and a static recording/transcript/summary JSON document. Full-demo shares
used a fixed path, moment shares encoded content in query parameters, and reviewer
speaker edits and saved moments used browser storage. These were intentional demo
content but did not satisfy the final persistence requirement.

The explicit seed is now `supabase/seeds/reviewer-meetings.json`, applied by
`npm run seed:reviewer` through `scripts/seed-reviewer.mjs`. The additive migration
is `supabase/migrations/202609230001_persist_reviewer_content.sql`. Both were applied
and the seed is idempotent. Four real database rows preserve the reviewer experience:
one permissioned recording with imported transcript/prepared analysis and three
clearly disclosed synthetic examples. The sanitized public video remains a deliberate
static asset; moving that asset to private R2 was unnecessary.

The same Worker/Supabase data adapter now serves reviewer and uploaded meetings.
Search reads current persisted content, moments and speaker edits persist to the
database, and public links resolve stored random tokens. React no longer imports
seed records. Removed static JSON/search arrays and stateless share parsers cannot
mask backend failure. Explicit loading, empty, and retry states replace fixtures.
Test fixtures remain confined to test imports and are disabled for deployed checks.
Dashboard payloads omit full transcript/intelligence data and do not fetch video.

Live testing exposed and fixed two additional issues: generated templates could
repeat a generic inapplicability overview, and PostgreSQL's offset timestamps in
private search results did not match the client contract. The analysis prompt now
requires perspective-specific explanations and retries duplicate outputs; private
search dates normalize to ISO UTC. Both have regression coverage. An export test
now waits for the persisted speaker-save confirmation before copying.

All important data flows use real persistence. Reviewer seeds and private uploads
use separate tables in the same database to maintain the public/private boundary.
Private moment sharing remains deliberately unavailable; private full meetings
can be shared and revoked. Legacy query-string moment links/fixed demo links are
replaced by stored-token links. Old browser-only moments are not automatically
imported; create fresh links from the current product.

## Verification evidence

- Typecheck, ESLint, production build, and all **50 unit/API tests passed**.
- Local Chromium/mobile suite: 73 passed, eight intentional environment/project
  skips, and one artifact-cleanup failure caused by overlapping Playwright output
  directories. Its isolated rerun passed (one case, 5.7 seconds), completing
  verification of all 74 applicable cases; no product assertion failed.
- Eight deployed reviewer checks passed: playback/speed/follow, summary templates
  and action sources, real search seeking, persisted moments, bounded share playback,
  full public sharing, isolated speaker edits, and the six-width showcase audit.
- Deployed desktop/mobile recovery/export audit: 30 initial passes plus two export
  timing failures; both passed after awaiting save confirmation. A further eight-case
  deployed export/containment/recovery run passed (two duplicate mobile matrix skips).
- The final **real provider ingestion test passed** in 33.7 seconds. It uploaded the
  approved WebM directly to R2, received real Whisper transcript and Llama analysis,
  played/searched/sought the recording, switched three distinct summaries, persisted
  speaker rename and a moment across reload, copied/downloaded transcript, verified
  clean-browser privacy, created/played/revoked a public meeting link, found the
  private meeting in cross-meeting search, and permanently deleted it through the UI.
  Deployed traces/video were disabled to avoid capturing signed URLs or guest credentials.
- Controlled API failures on the deployed frontend verified library/search errors,
  save failures, upload recovery, transcription/analysis failure and retry, stopped
  polling, missing/deleted content, invalid/revoked shares, and empty transcript/search.
  Provider outages were simulated, not deliberately caused at the provider.
- Top/middle/bottom scrolling and column containment passed at **1920, 1440, 1280,
  1024, 768, and 390px** across dashboard, upload, meeting, public meeting, and public
  moment routes. Desktop/mobile screenshots were inspected. Physical devices and
  Safari are **NOT VERIFIED**.
- Database aggregates confirmed four reviewer meetings, no orphan moments, and
  RLS/direct-browser-role isolation on all six application tables. Three historical
  automated verification uploads were removed; all six related staging/media object
  absence checks returned 404. Current live-test uploads were deleted by the test.
  The final aggregate check found zero verification uploads and zero orphan moments.
- The public application works over HTTPS in fresh contexts without developer
  credentials. It is served by Cloudflare, independent of the developer machine.
- Secret scanning checks current tracked/nonignored files, production bundles, all
  reachable historical text blobs, and commit messages against configured secret
  values and high-confidence patterns. It passed. `.dev.vars`, `.env`, and local env
  variants remain ignored; `.env.example` contains names only. Five capture files
  remain tracked. Raw reference artifacts remain ignored; only approved derivatives
  are public. No credentials were printed during administration.
- Unauthenticated https://github.com/zeddspear/tavrex-ai returned **HTTP 404**.
  Public repository readiness is not claimed; final commits are local by instruction.

## Remaining constraints and hand-in actions

There is no known unresolved core-flow defect from this audit. This is still a
bounded assessment deployment: seven-day browser ownership, no account recovery,
foreground processing, no retention job, and provider/free-tier quotas. Losing the
guest cookie loses private-owner access. Public content depends on Supabase reads.
No configured secret exposure was found; the scan is not a guarantee against every
possible unknown credential format. No rotation is indicated by these results.

1. Push the local `mvp` commits manually and ensure the reviewer-visible/default
   branch contains them. Confirm the repository URL opens in incognito; correct
   visibility or the documented URL if it still returns 404.
2. Personally follow the short product-review route in `SUBMISSION.md` once.
3. Supply the camera-on walkthrough of at most five minutes if meeting the official
   hand-in requirements. It remains omitted by the candidate's prior choice; this
   report does not claim formal assessment completeness without it.
4. Submit the public application/repository and walkthrough links. Freeze feature
   scope; only fix submission-blocking defects.
